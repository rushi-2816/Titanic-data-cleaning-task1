# Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Task 1 ‚Äì AI & ML Internship

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset.

### ‚úÖ What I Did:
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropped Cabin column
- Encoded 'Sex' and 'Embarked'
- Scaled Age and Fare
- Removed outliers from Fare
- Saved cleaned CSV

### üìÅ Files:
- task1_preprocessing.ipynb
- titanic_cleaned.csv

### üîó Dataset:

## ‚ùì Interview Questions & Answers

**1. What are the different types of missing data?**  
- MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)  
- MAR (Missing At Random)  
- MNAR (Missing Not At Random)

**2. How do you handle categorical variables?**  
- Use Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding  
- One-Hot for non-ordinal categories (like City)  
- Label for ordinal categories (like Education level)

**3. What is the difference between normalization and standardization?**  
- Normalization scales data to [0,1]  
- Standardization transforms data to have mean=0 and std=1

**4. How do you detect outliers?**  
- Using boxplots, z-score, or IQR method

**5. Why is preprocessing important in ML?**  
- Ensures data is clean, consistent, and suitable for training models  
- Prevents bias or poor performance

**6. What is one-hot encoding vs label encoding?**  
- One-Hot: Converts category into binary columns  
- Label: Assigns a number to each category (e.g., Male=0, Female=1)

**7. How do you handle data imbalance?**  
- Oversampling minority class (SMOTE),  
- Undersampling majority class,  
- Using weighted models

**8. Can preprocessing affect model accuracy?**  
- Yes, good preprocessing can significantly improve model performance.
